# vagrant-puppet
This project was created to mimic a development environment to build and test Puppet code.

It holds my many attempts to perfect the CI/CD process of deploying and testing puppet code
into multiple environments.

## Prerequisites

- A Hypervisor to host VMs - setup with Virtual Box (v5.2.18 r124319)
- Vagrant (v2.2.5)
- Packer (v1.6.4)
